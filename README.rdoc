== Instavention

This is a Rails/Backbone Instagram app allowing users to play with their Instagram feeds. Users can log-in with Instagram and play a guessing game to match the five matched photos for a win, or uncover a 'photo bomb' for a loss.

Optionally, a user can log-in as a guest and play with the most popular photos on Instagram.
